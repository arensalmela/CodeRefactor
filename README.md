This project is called CodeRefactor.

I was tasked with refactoring current HTML with more user friendly semantic HTML elements.

Here is the acceptance criteria of the assignment.

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The largest changes included changing <div> to semantic HTML elements. This includes <main> , <section> , <nav> , <aside> , and <footer>.
Semantic elements help describe the meaning in a easier manner to the browser and developer.\*\*\*

CSS selectors and properties were also consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure that was changed within the orginal HTML.

Here are the grading requirements of the assignment.
